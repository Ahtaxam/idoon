## Challenges Faced

During the development of this project, I encountered several challenges, particularly in managing the state of filters. Some key points include:

- **State Management**: I initially struggled with effectively managing the state of various filters, especially given the complexity of the filter structure. Storing filter values in the state proved challenging.

- **Displaying Applied Filters**: Ensuring that the applied filters were displayed correctly and were easy to remove was another challenge. This required a modular approach to build reusable components that could handle the display and interaction logic seamlessly.
